## 📖 About The Project

**Student Performance Predictor AI** is not just another data science script—it's a **full-stack, production-ready AI application** engineered to provide actionable insights into student performance.

Built to bridge the gap between heavy machine learning models and intuitive user interfaces, this system processes over **20,000+ student records** to identify the key drivers of academic success. Whether you are an educator, a student, or a developer, this platform offers a robust environment to explore educational data.

### 🎯 Key Features

- **🧠 Advanced Predictive Engine**: Powered by a finely-tuned Linear Regression model achieving **73% R² Accuracy**.
- **⚡ High-Performance API**: Built with **FastAPI** for sub-millisecond inference latency.
- **🎨 Modern Dashboard**: A stunning, responsive Dark Mode UI crafted with **Next.js 14** and **Tailwind CSS**.
- **🔍 Explainable AI (XAI)**: Understand *why* a prediction was made with detailed feature contribution breakdowns.
- **🐳 Containerized & Portable**: Fully Dockerized for "write once, run anywhere" deployment.
